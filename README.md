## Analysis
Databel provided a data set of 6,687 unique customers and information reguarding phone plans and usuage. They wanted to better undestand their customer churn rate to
come up with future marketing inititives to reduece overall chrun. Chrun rate was defined as the number of customs chruned divided by the number of total customers.
## Key Findings 
The dashboard was spilt into three smaller dashboards focusing on overview,demographics and phone plans. The first key insight discovered was that customers who 
identified as seniors were 14% more like to churn then customers who did not define as seniors. As customers went up in age, their chrun rates tended to increase 
aswell. It should also be noted that number of customers in that age bracket decresed as well. Seniors only represent 18% of all customers in this data set 

The next key finding was reguarding number of people in the phone plane. The data was split into customers groups 0 to 5 with 0 being only 1 person and 5 being 5 
people in the group. The churn rate for customers with 0 people in their group was 32% while customers with just one more person was only 6%. Average Monthly charge for groups
with zero were also 30% higher then people with at least 1 person on their plan. Service calls were almost double as well for groups of zero.
