## Overview
Databel provided a data set of 6,687 unique customers and information regarding phone plans and usage. Databel wanted to better understand their customer churn rate to come up with future marketing initiatives to reduce overall churn. Churn rate was defined as the number of customs churned divided by the number of total customers.
## Key Findings 
The dashboard was spilt into three smaller dashboards focusing on overview, demographics and customer phone plans. The first key insight discovered was those customers who 
identified as seniors were 14% more like to churn then customers who did not define as seniors. As customers went up in age, their churn rates tended to increase 
as well. It should also be noted that number of customers in that age bracket decreased as well. Seniors only represent 18% of all customers in this data set 

The next key finding was regarding number of people in the phone plane. The data was split into customers groups 0 to 5 with 0 being only 1 person and 5 being 5 
people in the phone plan the churn rate for customers with 0 people in their group was 32% while customers with just one more person was only 6%. Average Monthly charge for groups
with zero were also 30% higher than people with at least 1 person on their plan. Service calls were almost double as well for groups of zero.

The purchase and use of international phone plans effected overall churn rate. Customers who purchased international phone plans but were not active in using their plan churned at 71% where customers who were active only had a 7% churn rate. 

The last key finding and arguably the most significate was regarding account length and type of contract the customer was using. Month to month accounts were all averaged under 20 months and had the highest churn rates in all payment categories with payment by paper checks having the highest churn rate of 57%. One year and 2-year contact accounts had low churn rates across the board. Month to Month contacts represent the largest portion of customers out of the three contact types. 
## Advice 

1: Incentivize customers with single lines more than multi line contacts to become more completive with other phone companies and making price or features not be a reason for leaving.

2: Let customers know about which features the are paying for with their current contact so they can decide if their current plan is right for them or if they need a plan the better suits their needs. 

3: Offer slight rebates on price to month to month when they enroll in online billing.

4: Offer more flexible contact types for 1 year and 2-year contracts to incentivize customers to move away from month to month contacts and into yearly contracts.
